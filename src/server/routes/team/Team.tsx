// For some godforsaken reason, if I call this component 'Team', I get
// hydration errors. Specifically, the error:
//   Warning: Prop `className` did not match. Server: "css-2jddn0-Team2" Client: "css-tzd8vf-Team"
//
// I did some digging, but couldn't find anything to explain why only this
// component has this problem. Got no where. Finally, on a hunch, I tried
// renaming the component to "Team2" just to see what would happen. The errors
// disappear. I have no idea why. I also don't have the emotional bandwidth or
// time to go spelunking through emotion's SSR vs. client-side code paths.
// Certainly seems like some sort of component name cache issue. But as far as I
// can tell, I don't have two "Team" components. Ugh. Whatever.
//
// Future me (or someone else) may get some eudaimonic joy from figuring out the
// problem. Right now me wants to move the ball forward on the project without
// any side quests.
